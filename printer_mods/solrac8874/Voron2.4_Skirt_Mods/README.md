<B>Voron 2.4 Side Skirt mods for fanless and/or 40mm Fan support.</B>

These side middle skirts are designed to either go fanless or allow use of a 40mm fan instead of the default 60mm.

MCU Board cooling may be impacted using 40mm fans instead of 60mm fans. I don't have 60mm fans and plan on using 40x20mm fans left over from my old V2.2 toolheads (replaced by Afterburner toolheads). 

Fanless middle side skirt is similar to the <a href="https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/xbst_/V2.4_Fanless_Middle_Skirt">V2.4_Fanless_Middle_Skirt</a> by <a href="https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/xbst_">xbst_</a>, but has end profiles matching the side_a & side_b skirts.

Mix and match the side skirt mods on either side.  Middle skirts should fit all Voron 2.4 sizes (250, 300, 350).
